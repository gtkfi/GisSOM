        #### *Dash is a Python framework for building analytical web applications. No JavaScript required*.
        
        Built on top of Plotly.js, React and Flask, Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs directly to your analytical python code. Read our tutorial proudly crafted ❤️ by dash itself.

        ### App Samples
        
        | App | Description |
        |--- | :---: |
        | ![Sample Dash App](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1280389/30086128-9bb4a28e-9267-11e7-8fe4-bbac7d53f2b0.gif) | Here’s a simple example of a Dash App that ties a Dropdown to a D3.js Plotly Graph. As the user selects a value in the Dropdown, the application code dynamically exports data from Google Finance into a Pandas DataFrame. This app was written in just **43** lines of code ([view the source](https://gist.github.com/chriddyp/3d2454905d8f01886d651f207e2419f0)). |
        |![crossfiltering dash app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1280389/30086123-97c58bde-9267-11e7-98a0-7f626de5199a.gif)|Dash app code is declarative and reactive, which makes it easy to build complex apps that contain many interactive elements. Here’s an example with 5 inputs, 3 outputs, and cross filtering. This app was composed in just 160 lines of code, all of which were Python.|
        |  ![Dash app with Mapbox map showing walmart store openings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1280389/30086299-768509d0-9268-11e7-8e6b-626ac9ca512c.gif)| Dash uses [Plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) for charting. Over 35 chart types are supported, including maps. |
        |![Financial report](https://github.com/plotly/dash-docs/blob/516f80c417051406210b94ea23a6d3b6cd84d146/assets/images/gallery/dash-financial-report.gif)| Dash isn't just for dashboards. You have full control over the look and feel of your applications. Here's a Dash app that's styled to look like a PDF report. |
